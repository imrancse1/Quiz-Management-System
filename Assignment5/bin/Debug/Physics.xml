<ques>Which of Newton's Three Laws does the following statement satisfy? The relationship between an object's mass (m), its acceleration (a), and the applied force F is F=ma. Acceleration and force are vectors. This law requires that the direction of the acceleration vector is in the same direction as the force vector.</ques>
